Rock Band in 15 minutes
=======================

These are the corresponding code fragments which go along with a talk I give about how to write Rock Band in 15 mins. Now, it isn't the full Rock Band, but it is something that is easily written. This is geared towards kids wanting to learn programming or adults.
